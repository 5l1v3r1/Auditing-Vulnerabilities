# Auditing-Vulnerabilities
In this repository I'll host my research and methodologies for auditing vulnerabilities. <b>Perpetually in the works.</b> 


### XXE 
Talking about JAVA and PHP XXE. I'll be documenting what I've learned going over the basic concepts, from the basic concept principle=> utilization=> auditin => defense.

### HTTP Smuggling 
Talking about HTTP-Smuggling and how it leverages the different ways that a particularly crafted HTTP message can be parsed and interpreted by different agents (browsers, web caches, application firewalls)...
