### CSRF (Cross-site request forgery), Chinese name: Cross-Site Request Forgery, also known as: one click attack / session riding, abbreviated: CSRF / XSRF.    

#### That this all about? 
The user logged in to website with a username and password in a browser. The website “A” matched the username and password and returned a cookie to the browser user. When he visited the website, the first verification took effect (cookies for access). At this time, most of them are in the era of multi-tab browsers. When the user does not exit the website a and opens a new tab to visit the website “B”, the website “B” returns an offensive malicious code to request the user's browser to send a request to the website “A”  Website “A” has identified the user cookie verification and successfully executed website “B”'s malicious request or code. The attack is complete.
